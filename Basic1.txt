whatever you want
THis is basic_repo assignment

File has been modified. YEA!!

If file is index.locked this is the way to fix it
rm .git/index.lock
rm .git/index
git read-tree --reset HEAD


If file is untrack or modified and wont update the git hub.
must go into each folder look for .git that is created
ls -alf
rm -rf .git                     -- to remove the git
git rm -r --cache .             -- re empty the cache.
git add .                       -- to re add the file again and rest is same to push up
git commit -m "fixing git track"
git push origin master
